					<h1>30th CSI Karnataka Students Convention</h1>
					<span>Team Suraksha</span>
					<p> It was the 30th CSI Karnataka Students Convention which was held at K.S Institute of Technology on November 10th, 11th and 12th, 2016 in which I, Aishwarya and my teammates Meghana, Hemashri and Pooja participated under the guidance of Asst Prof. Bharatesh Chakravarthi.</p>
					<p>As we reached the venue, there was a lot of hubbub about where exactly to go as there were a lot of students from many colleges. Quiz, logo designing, web designing, word-war, pic-charades, bug me out and many such events were going to be held equidistantly.</p>
					<p>Paper presentation was one among them. Before getting into the competition, we had two rounds. First was to mail our paper to them and if we got through it, second was to mail our power point presentation. All the papers were scrutinized by the CSI panel members and out of hundred plus papers, best forty were selected. We were really blissed that our paper was one among those forty papers.</p>
					<p>Our slots for presentation were given and we had to present on 11th. Pooja , our team member represented our team. It was quiet a tough competition. There were participants from colleges like Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering, RV College of Engineering, JSS, APS, KSIT etc. But our presentation went really well.</p>
					<p>Finally all the teams were done with their presentations. The valedictory was held on 12th and it was time to announce the winners. All four of us were really tensed as to what the results would be. As they announced our names for the 1st consolation prize, we were really rejoiced. We were called on the stage and were awarded with a cash price. Overall it was a marvellous experience and something that we would treasure for a life time. The whole feat was possible merely because of our beloved guide Mr.Bharatesh for having believed in us and constantly encouraging us at every step.</p>
